Usage: virt-dup.sh --original vmname [options]

Motivation of this tool is to duplicate a Virtual Machine in seconds.
To reach that speed, the trick is to deploy all VM images in the
filesystem with the native COW(--reflink) capability, eg. btrfs,
xfs-4.16, ocfs2, etc. 

It is created, just because virt-clone does not yet leverage the native
COW(--reflink) capability of the filesystem to duplicate qcow2. It only
support RAW by now at the end of 2018. virt-clone might take noticeable
time to duplicate qcow2 image files. Well, it is understandable
virt-clone wants to keep the advantage of qcow2 backing file
functionality for existent use cases.

This tool will 
- reset MAC to be unique
- reset static IP to dhcp
- cleanup hosts for the legacy ip - hostname record
- reset hostname to the new Virtual Machine


Tips:
- to let a image shared among Virtual Machines, you should avoid
  the Virttual Machine name to be the substring of that image name.
