Usage: virt-dup.sh --original name [options]

This tool let you have fun to duplicate a Virtual Machine with qcow2 
and raw images in seconds, under those filesystems with the native
COW(--reflink) capability eg. btrfs, xfs-4.16, ocfs2. 

It is created, just because virt-clone does not yet leverage the native
COW capability of filesystems to duplicate qcow2. It only support RAW by
now at the end of 2018. virt-clone might need a long time to duplicate
qcow2 files, especially if they have backing files. With this, be
caution, this tool doesn't support qcow2 with baking files.

This tool will reset MAC and hostname of the Virtual Machine.

Options:
-h, --help
-v, --verbose, -d, --debug
-o, --original ORIGINAL_GUEST_NAME
-n, --name NEW_GUEST_NAME
