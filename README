Usage: virt-dup --original vmname [options]

Motivation of this tool is to duplicate a Virtual Machine in seconds.
To reach that speed, the trick is to deploy all VM images in the
filesystem with the native COW(--reflink) capability, eg. btrfs,
xfs-4.16, ocfs2, etc. 

It is created, just because virt-clone does not yet leverage the native
COW(--reflink) capability of the filesystem to duplicate qcow2. It only
support RAW by now at the end of 2018. virt-clone might take noticeable
time to duplicate qcow2 image files. Well, it is understandable
virt-clone wants to keep the advantage of qcow2 backing file
functionality for existent use cases.

Functionalities of this tool includes:
- reset MAC to be unique
- reset hostname to the new Virtual Machine
- an option not to enforce dhcp, and can add secondary IP
- an option to add hostname to hosts


Tips:
- to let a image shared among Virtual Machines, you should avoid
  the Virttual Machine name to be the substring of that image name.


Options:
-h, --help
-v, --verbose, -vv, -vvv for more debugging information
-o, --original ORIGINAL_GUEST_NAME
-n, --name NEW_GUEST_NAME[,ip=w.x.y.z/m,nodhcp,hosts]
     ip=        (optional, no default,  m default 24)
     nodhcp     means no attempt to enforce DHCP (default no this option)
